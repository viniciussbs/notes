h2. About Erlang

Erlang is a functional language where the concurrency is tied to the language itself, and not to the operating system.
The language uses message exchanging to interact with parallel processes without creating locks or synchronization methods.
A simple Erlang program can create thousands to millions of lightweight processes that can be executed on single or multi-core 
processors, and even on a network of processors.

Erlang was designed for programming fault-tolerant systems. It was originally developed in the Computer Science Laboratory at the Swedish Telecom company Ericsson.

Erlang is about:

* Concurrency
* Distribution
* Fault tolerance
* Functional programming
* Speeding up applications on multi-core CPUs
